<p> I joined Girlswhocode this summer.</p>
<p>We talked a lot about robots and their ethics today. I am curious about the future of robots. There will be new technology and ideas in the future. We worked in groups and something that worked well was we were able to talk to each other and communciate ideas and explain what we were confused about.</p>
